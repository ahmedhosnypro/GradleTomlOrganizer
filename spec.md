## Developing a Production-Grade Kotlin Script for dependency Optimization

Create a robust, extensible Kotlin script for optimizing dependency files, suitable for production environments and complex scenarios.

**I. Core Functionality:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - **Command-Line Arguments:**
     - **Required:**
       - `--input <file_path>`: Path to the input dependency file.
     - **Optional:**
       - `--output <file_path>`: Path to the output file (default: console output).
       - `--verbosity <level>`: Verbosity level (e.g., `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv` for increasing detail).
       - `--strict`: Enable strict mode for error handling.
       - `--strategy <strategy_name>`: Custom conflict resolution strategy.
   - **Configuration File:**
     - Support a `.kotlindepconfig` file for persistent settings.
   - **Input Formats:**
     - **Primary:** Gradle-style dependency format.
     - Extensible architecture for future format support (e.g., TOML, YAML).

2. **Parsing and AST:**
   - Implement a robust parser using advanced regex patterns.
   - Construct an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with nodes like:
     - `VersionDeclaration`
     - `LibraryDeclaration`
     - `BundleDeclaration`
     - `CommentNode`
   - Preserve original file structure, including comments and formatting.

3. **Version Management:**
   - Strict SemVer 2.0.0 compliance.
   - Support for version ranges (e.g., `^1.2.3`, `~2.0`).
   - Implement multiple conflict resolution strategies:
     - **Default:** Highest version.
     - Prefer stable versions.
     - Prefer specific channel (e.g., alpha, beta).
     - Custom user-defined strategies.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Granular error types (e.g., `MalformedLineError`, `VersionConflictError`).
   - Detailed error reporting with line numbers and context.
   - Recovery mechanisms in non-strict mode.
   - Proper exception handling and logging.

5. **Output Generation:**
   - Maintain original file structure and comments.
   - Configurable output formats (e.g., compact, pretty-printed).
   - Support for differential output (show only changes).

**II. Advanced Features:**

1. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement parallel processing for large files.
   - Use efficient data structures (e.g., trie for version lookups).
   - Lazy evaluation where appropriate.

2. **Extensibility:**
   - Plugin architecture for custom parsers and output generators.
   - Hook system for custom processing steps.

3. **Integration:**
   - Provide a library interface for embedding in other Kotlin projects.
   - Implement a simple HTTP API for remote usage.

4. **Security:**
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs.
   - Implement rate limiting for API usage.
   - Support for cryptographic signatures on dependency files.

**III. Testing and Quality Assurance:**

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite:**
   - Unit tests for all core components.
   - Integration tests with real-world dependency files.
   - Property-based testing for edge cases.
   - Performance benchmarks.

2. **Code Quality:**
   - Enforce Kotlin coding conventions.
   - Use static analysis tools (e.g., Detekt).
   - Aim for 90%+ code coverage.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Extensive KDoc comments.
   - Generated API documentation.
   - User guide with examples and best practices.

**IV. Build and Distribution:**

1. **Build Process:**
   - Use Gradle for build automation.
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).

2. **Packaging:**
   - Create an executable JAR.
   - Provide native binaries for major platforms.
   - Publish to Maven Central.

3. **Versioning:**
   - Follow SemVer for the tool itself.
   - Maintain a detailed CHANGELOG.

**V. User Experience:**

1. **CLI Improvements:**
   - Interactive mode for manual conflict resolution.
   - Progress bars for long-running operations.
   - Colored console output for better readability.

2. **Reporting:**
   - Generate detailed HTML reports of changes.
   - Export dependency graphs.

3. **Update Mechanism:**
   - Self-update feature to keep the tool current.
